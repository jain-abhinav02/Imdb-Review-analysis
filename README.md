# Imdb-Review-analysis
My first deep learning based project on Natural language Processing. This simple project introduces the major libraries and functions required in any NLP project. The IMDb review dataset is available within the keras library itself which makes it easier to start the project without having to go through websites to look for the dataset. Also the dataset is already divided into train and test set.

## Things learnt
1. Padding Sequences
2. Using Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) or Long short term memory(LSTM) unit in RNN
3. Using Embedding layer/matrix
